<p>This page is a display of my entire life's work and projects that I have attempted, completed and working on. This list is incomplete as many of the projects I have worked on have slipped my mind or are too minisule to include. I hope you find what you are looking for and I will always be happy to answer and questions at my email.</p>

<h2 class='anchor'>Projects</h2>
<h3>Undergraduate Thesis</h3>
<h4>Simulation of Light Yield for a Next Generation Liquid Argon Dark Matter 
Detector</h4>
<pre><code>Investigated the effectiveness of Quartz Intensifying Photon Detectors
in detecting photons

Used Geant4, a particle physics simulation toolkit to simulate the 
detector environment

Close collaboration with scientists at SNOLab’s DEAP-3600 Dark Matter
team to help develop and prepare for a next generation detector

Prepared a rough cost analysis for two version of a $100 million dollar
50T detector and $500 million dollar 500T detector by extrapolating
prices of the existing 10T detector
</code></pre>
<h3>Design and Prototype of a Laser Microphone</h3>
<pre><code>Headed a team to create a working prototype of a laser microphone capable of
using a laser to measure small fluctuations in windows or thin surfaces 
to record sound.

Worked and lead a team seamlessly to completion and to meet all deadlines

Investigated different methods to attain goal such as laser interferometry
with the use of a lockin amplifier
</code></pre>

<pre><code>Royal Military College of Canada
  Research Assistant 
    Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering
      Investigated airflow over NACA0012 airfoil using ANSYS software,
      CFX and ICEM CFD for meshing

      Developed a working knowledge of ANSYS software through trial
      and error, as well as communicating with ANSYS technical support

      Coordinated with supervisor about the physical theory of the 
      airflow problem

      Provided perspectives to undergraduates about their various 
      thesis projects

      Provided day-to-day assistance to the staff Lab Technicians 
      alleviating extraneous workload allowing for a smoother operation of
      the team (eg. rearranging lab equipment, cable management, general 
      labour etc).
</code></pre>

<pre><code>York Region
  Transit Department
    Engineering Intern 
      Collaborated on the Presto Smart Card project; aimed at providing 
      public transit commuters with a single card to travel the Greater
      Toronto Area with public transit.

      Provided solutions to on-bus technologies, such as security cameras,
      data logging machines etc.

      Provided recommendation and critique on implementation techniques 
      such as proper places to mount the card reader, visibility of the
      reader to the public, reaction of the public to the device and 
      protocol of using the device

      Reviewed device documentation for inconsistencies and potential errors.
